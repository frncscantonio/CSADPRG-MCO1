## Overview
The developed software application is a weekly payroll system that was designed to specifically manage and record employee workday information efficiently with the utilization of the Kotlin programming language. It provides a simple menu-driven interface that allows a user to input and edit necessary details. It enables quick adjustments specifically to day types, time in, and time for each day. Furthermore, it utilizes the information the user provides to automatically compute their total salary for the day and the entire week.

## Installation
To run the program on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Kotlin installed on your system. If not, refer to the official Kotlin website for installation instructions.
2. In your terminal, compile the Kotlin files and create the executable JAR file:
```
main.kt DayInfo.kt -include-runtime -d main.jar
```
3. Run the application
```
java -jar main.jar
```
